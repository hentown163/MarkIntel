#### Cost Control
- **Issue**: No built-in cost tracking or budget limits for LLM API calls
- **Impact**: Potential for unexpected costs with high usage
- **Mitigation**: Manual monitoring required
- **Future**: Implement cost tracking, daily/monthly budget limits, and usage alerts

#### Response Quality Variability
- **Issue**: LLM responses can vary in quality and structure
- **Impact**: May require regeneration for optimal results
- **Mitigation**: Structured output validation and retry logic
- **Future**: Fine-tuned models, response quality scoring
